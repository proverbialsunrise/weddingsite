Bedrock is a quick way to start an [Express](http://expressjs.com) app with nice defaults without having to worry about setup and configuration. It is a collection of modules and libraries that I find myself using in almost every Express app that I make. Bedrock removes the repetition that is involved when building a new Express app.
